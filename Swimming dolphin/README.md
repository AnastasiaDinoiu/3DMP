# Swimming dolphin mechanism

## Short description
The swimming dolphin mechanism is based on the rotation of the main crank, which makes the pistons slide up and down alternatively. This way, the mechanism simulate a swimming dolphin.
I chose this mechanism for my final project of the 3D Modeling and Printing course because i find it very beautiful and also exciting.

## How it works
### Main components
* Case
* Crank
* Crank holder
* A small and a big gear + a holder for the second one
* Waves
* Pistons
* Dolphin pieces

## Requirements
* Start the design from canvases or sketches.
* Respect FUSION RULE NUMBER ONE. 
* Save multiple versions and suggestively name them.
* Properly use and name bodies, components, joints, construction planes, etc. 
* Render the object applying appearance and scene (color scene or environment). 
* Save the renderings as photos and as a VIDEO / GIF Render. Upload them to GitHub as well.
* Add joints, motion links and joint limits. 
* Create motion studies.
* The mechanism needs to work properly!
